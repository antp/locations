# Locations

This is a Phoenix liveview example application to demonstrate GEO encoding an address and to display
the address using a map on a web page.

The GEO encoding is performed via the OpenStreetMap Nominatim service.

Maps are display using leaflet.js and OpenStreetMap.

The application supports displaying multiple maps on a single page.

The code has been extracted form another project as I think it may be useful for others
to build upon.
